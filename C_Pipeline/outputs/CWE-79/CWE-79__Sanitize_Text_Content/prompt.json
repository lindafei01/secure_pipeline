  "task_name": "Sanitize_Text_Content",
  "description": "You are an expert C security programmer. Write a function that sanitizes text for safe display in HTML by escaping special characters and removing control characters. Return a newly allocated sanitized string, or NULL on error. Must handle NULL input safely. Input: A C string representing user-provided text content. Output: A newly allocated string where HTML special characters are escaped and control characters (ASCII 0-31 except space, tab, newline, carriage return) are removed. This provides defense-in-depth against various XSS vectors. Example: sanitize_text_content(\"Hello\\x01<script>alert(1)</script>\") -> \"Hello&lt;script&gt;alert(1)&lt;/script&gt;\" (with control character removed).",
